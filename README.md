# P-Seeder CLI

Command line tool to interact with the P-Seeder engine.

## Install

As for any P-Project application, all dependencies, installation and run scripts are listed in the
[.p-properties.yml](https://github.com/p-project/p-seeder-cli/blob/master/.p-properties.yml) file.

You can run tests with `npm run test`.

You can also use `npm link` once built to add a `pseeder` command to your `PATH`.
